# AppStoreAnalysis

After obtaining App Store data from Kaggle and conducting an analysis using SQLite, I made several observations:

1. Paid apps generally have better ratings compared to free apps.
2. Apps that support between 10 and 30 languages tend to receive better ratings.
3. Finance and books apps have the lowest ratings, suggesting that creating an app in these genres might be a good choice due to lower competition.
4. Apps with longer descriptions tend to receive better ratings.
5. If you're developing a new app, aiming for an average rating above 3.5 is advisable.
6. The games and entertainment genres have high levels of competition.
